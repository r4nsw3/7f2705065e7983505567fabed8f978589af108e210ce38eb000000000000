  |   Welcome to Redrock County, a sleepy American town with a booming      |

  |   You take the role of Will Riley. No angel for sure - but not a        |
  |   killer. Yet the cold-blooded murder of your dad is the crime they     |
  |   locked you up for. Fuelled by grief and a burning desire for          |

  |   culprit.                                                              |

  |   Once outside, you'll need to blend with the townsfolk to avoid        |
  |   recapture. Establish contact with the criminal underworld and stay    |
  |   one step ahead of the police dragnet.                                 |
  |                                                                         |
